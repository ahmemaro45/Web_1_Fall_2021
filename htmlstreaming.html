        Hulu is a streaming platform owned by The Walt Disney Company, with Comcast's NBCUniversal holding a minority stake. Hulu is exclusive to the United States and is not available in other countries.

Hulu was initially established as a joint venture between News Corporation and NBC Universal, Providence Equity Partners, and later The Walt Disney Company, serving as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series from their respective television networks. In 2010, Hulu became the first streaming service to add "Plus" to its name when it launched a subscription service, initially branded as Hulu Plus, which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, and undelayed access to new episodes.[
